        <p>
          In 2018, I assisted a student named Erin (pseudonym) with the technical elements of a performance. Erin is a dancer and costume designer who was producing a dance performance for her undergraduate senior thesis. Her performance was around exploring relationships between di↵erent forms of dance, and she wanted to use light-up, interactive costumes to convey these relationships to the audience. I hoped that through supporting a performer’s creative technical goals I would get firsthand insight into the a↵ordances and challenges of participating in an artist- technologist collaboration, as well as elucidate the limitations of novice-oriented physical computing tools.

        </p>

        <p>
Erin is a talented costume designer and has prior experience working with wearable electron- ics. She enjoys sewing LEDs into her costumes to make them light up. She also has programming experience from a few introductory undergraduate courses, and from her prior experience using the
micro:bit to change the colors of the lights in her costumes. Still, even with her experience creating light-up costumes, she was overwhelmed by how to implement the complex interactive system that she envisioned for her performance, and conveyed little interest in learning how to implement the software herself. This was understandable as she was responsible for all of the other aspects of the show — building a trapeze, choreographing the performance, recruiting dancers, sewing her costumes, picking the accompanying music for the show, etc. In one meeting Erin said, “Someone asked me today about my project and I said if I didn’t have to build anything I’d be happy. I care about the final product, not so much the process.” However, she initially had to try implement- ing everything herself because, as an undergraduate student, she did not have the budget or the resources to hire an expert technologist to assist her. I offered to collaborate for free and took on the role of implementing the software for Erin’s costumes.

        Based on the meetings I had with Erin I was able to start programming the lighting animations of her costumes.

        <p>
        The actual performance took place on May 4, 2018. There were about 60 people in attendance. This collaboration taught me how to better communicate with artists in technical collaborations in order to design systems that meet their creative needs.
